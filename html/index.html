				<p>Trondheim, Norway</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Wellstarter is an oil and gas service company developing a system for
					improving the observability of inflow rates within oil wells. This is
					done by generating signals in the form of heat pulses in oil wells which
					are propagated and affected by the inflow rates upstream and downstream
					of the source location which can be measured at the "heel" of the well.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I started working part-time at Wellstarter to develop an ERP solution.
					Being an oil and gas service company, Wellstarter is expected to provide
					detailed information on every part of its product such as material
					certificates, logistics tracking, production process and product testing.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					During my final year at NTNU i cooperated with Wellstarter on both my
					project and master thesis. Sjur Mo, Senior Staff Production Engineer and
					Ph.D in applied physics, supervised and offered great insight into numerically
					solving physical systems.

				<br>
				<p>
					During my time in the infantry i was fortunate to receive an advanced course in first-aid.
					Coupled with my interest for mountaineering and wildlife and an urge towards helping others,
					I started studying nursing with the aim of working in pre-hospital and emergency care.
					However I found that the sometimes rigid and conservative structure in healthcare coupled with strict
                    boundaries on careers didn't suit me very well.
                </p>

					The choice of Narvik was due to the spectacular mountains and amazing skiing possibilities.
					From my accomodations I could ski 500 meters downslope to the ski lifts which
					takes you to 1003 moh. and from there you can hike to 1272 while experiencing a magnificent
					view of the fjord. From the top you can ski right back down to the city centre.

			<h4>Force and strain measurements on a service boat</h4>

	        I was assigned the role of project leader for a project aimed at measuring the forces and strain in the tunnel
	        and around the crane foundation of a 15x12 meter catamaran. This also put me in the role of co-supervisor 
	        for the master thesis of one of Moen Marin's student employees.

			<h4>Smart Support</h4>
		
	        Together with a senior developer, <a href="hhttps://github.com/asbjorn">Asbjørn Fellinghaug</a>, I built a cloud
	        pipeline for storing data collected from boats in ScaleAQ's Elastic Search database. My main responsibility in
	        this project was developing the API for accessing both raw data and statistics. The tech stack for this project is:

		    <ul>
			    <li>Julia</li>
			    <li>Google Cloud</li>
			    <li>Elastic Search</li>
			</ul>

	        The most curious choice here is probably Julia for the API. Honestly i missed writing code in Julia
	        and i strongly believe it to be a good choice for handling large amounts of data efficiently. Moreover Julia
	        is an excellent language for machine learning making it an excellent all-in-one choice for an API providing
	        big data analytics.

			<h4>mLink Monitor</h4>

	        Starting in Moen Marin i quickly became responsible for our edge offering, mLink Monitor.
	        This solution was plagued by badly integrated and unsuitable third party software
	        meant to aid in transfer of data and storage in the cloud. With support from a senior developer
	        I provided the outline for a dockerized architecture with the aim of having a set of microservices, 
	        each performing a single task. The techonologies included are mainly:

			<ul>
				<li>Revolution Pi Core & Compact</li>
				<li>Docker</li>
				<li>PostgreSQL & TimescaleDB</li>
				<li>Golang</li>
				<li>Canbus</li>
				<li>Modbus</li>
				<li>MQTT</li>
			</ul>

	        Golang was chosen as the language to use for each service due to its very slim hardware footprint and excellent multithreading capabilities. 
	        With the help of a team of students working part-time we built modules to read data from each available data source 
	        onboard the ships such as engines, generators, weather station, navigation systems and more.

			<h4>Athos</h4>
			Wellstarter needed a system to individually track each component in systems sold to customers and installed in oil wells.
			I've made an attempt at creating such a system using Python Django along with PostgreSQL. The full list of technologies
			in the stack are:

			<ul>
				<li>Google cloud</li>
				<li>Docker</li>
				<li>Gunicorn</li>
				<li>Python Django</li>
				<li>PostgreSQL</li>
				<li>MS Graph</li>
				<li>Java script + JQuery</li>
				<li>CSS + bootstrap 4</li>
				<li>HTML5</li>
			</ul>

			Central to the backend is a recursive table structure defining individual components and assemblies.
			A corresponding recursive structure represents actual components that can be acquired throigh purchase orders
			or work orders. Components are tracked by connecting with a timestamp and an event which can for example be
			the component being destroyed in a test, made part of an assembly or passing through a country.
			Purchase orders for assemblies can include components sent from Wellstarter storage.
			A system for registering tests and tests results is also implemented including a micro-service for uploading
			live data from experiments and tests. Other features

				<li>Hardware: Raspberry pi, UPS,
				<li>Description</li>
				<li>State machines: Home/away, coffe machine, lighting etc.</li>
			</ul>
				I started building a system at a family cabin in 2017 with a hardware stack
				constisting of a raspberry pi, a usb z-wave stick and a various z-wave compatible sensors.
				I set up homeassistant using Docker and published the site using Nginx.
				In the years since the system has grown to encompass 2 cabins and my family home
				with the list of hardware now being:
				<ul>
					<li>2 Asus barebone machines</li>
					<li>2 UPS'es</li>
					<li>7 raspberry pi's</li>
					<li>5 pi cameras</li>
					<li>7 multisensors (temperature, PIR, light, pressure, humidity)</li>
					<li>8 smoke detectors, 5 with temperature sensor</li>
					<li>6 wall plugs</li>
					<li>12 thermostats</li>
					<li>1 weather station</li>
				</ul>
				The 5 pi's running cameras either livestream video or capture image/video on request.
				One of the cabins depend on gsm/4g making livestreaming a bit costly datawise.
				The 3 homes each have a dedicated server with the 2 cabins having UPS'es and using
				barebone machines rather than pi's. This is partly due to the weakness of the sd-card, causing
				the pi's to suddenly crash after a few years, always when noone are present.
				The software stack for the servers at each home are:
				<ul>
					<li>Docker</li>
					<li>Homeassistant</li>
					<li>PostgreSQL</li>
					<li>Nginx (except for the cabin on mobile net)</li>
